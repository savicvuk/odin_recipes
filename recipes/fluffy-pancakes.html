                <ol>
                    <li>Combine milk and vinegar in a medium bowl and set aside for 5 minutes to make sour milk.</li>
                    <li>Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large mixing bowl. Whisk egg and butter into soured milk. Pour flour mixture into milk mixture and whisk until lumps are gone.</li>
                    <li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat, and coat it with cooking spray. Pour 1/4 cupfuls of batter onto the skillet, and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 to 3 minutes. Flip with a spatula, and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
